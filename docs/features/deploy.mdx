import ThemedImage from '@theme/ThemedImage';

The deployment system is the main feature in DOM Cloud. It let's you to perform automatic configuration all by convenience of a single script. It's also can be used as a CI (Continous Integration) tool that perform some tasks inside your website.

The deployment system is accessible through `Deploy` tab in the website menu. 

<ThemedImage
    sources={{
        dark: "/assets/ss/new-progress-b.png",
        light: "/assets/ss/new-progress-w.png"
    }}
    alt=""
    className="img-fluid border rounded-3 shadow--md mb-4"

For common script deployments, there's existing recipes from [the deployment page](../deployment/index.mdx) or [recipe repository](https://github.com/domcloud/recipes).

We try to make it as simple as possible to understand. We also make our backend processing [open sourced](https://github.com/domcloud/bridge) so you take a better view of how it works if you want that.

The script runner is in YAML format. Here's a simple overview:

```yaml
source: # Source URL from internet to replace all files in "public_html"
features: # List of features to be enabled or configured or disabled
nginx:  # NGINX configuration to be set for current website
commands: # List of terminal commands that will be executed inside "public_html"
```

Each of these keys are explained in details below.

## `source`

Source URL from internet to replace all files in **~/public_html**. Common examples:

```yaml
# Clones octocat.github.io to  "~/public_html"
source: https://github.com/octocat/octocat.github.io
```

```yaml
# Download latest WordPress and extracts it from "wordpress" folder
source: 
  url: https://wordpress.org/latest.zip
  directory: wordpress
```

```yaml
# Removes all files and directories in "~/public_html"
source: clear
```

Type: `string` or `object`. If it a string, it will be the `url`.

If this value is set, it will download contents inside the host. The content can be either a ZIP file or a Git repository (to perform clone), or `clear` to simply clears the content.

:::tip

This option is useful if your files is already in a public repository such as GitHub. If you need to upload the files from your local device use [Webmin File Manager](./virtualmin).

:::

:::danger

This option will always **overwrite** all contents inside the host. Use with caution.

:::

### `url`
The zip (or clone) URL to download. Required.

### `type`
To `extract` a ZIP file or `clone` a repo. If omitted, it autodetects whether it is a `github.com` or `gitlab.com` URL and perform `clone` instead of `extract`.

### `directory` (`type: extract` only)
Specify the folder name to move out of ZIP file after extraction. This also can be specified from `url`'s hash. If omitted, no move operation performed.

> For legacy reason, a `directory` in root config will works too, it will be converted as `source.directory`.

### `branch` (`type: clone` only)
Specify the clone branch to get checked out. This also can be specified from directory or `url`'s hash. If omitted, the default branch is checked out.

### `shallow` (`type: clone` only)
Do shallow clone? Default to `true`. It is recommended to leave it that way to keep `.git` internal size low.

### `submodules` (`type: clone` only)
Do Recursive clone of submodules? Default to `false`.

---

## `features`

Enable, configure or disable one or more features in the website. Common examples:

```yaml
# Enable MySQL and PostgreSQL
features:
- mysql
- postgresql
```

```yaml
# Install latest Node.js and Python in the server
features:
- node
- python
```

```yaml
# Ask for a new TLS certificate from let's encrypt
features:
- ssl
```


Type: Array of `string` or `object`. If one item is a string, it will be converted to object (.e.g. `mysql on` become `{ mysql: on }`).

This configures all features available for the host in DOM Cloud.

### `mysql`

Configure MariaDB (MySQL) Database Server.

+ `mysql` or `mysql on` Enable MariaDB and create default DB.
+ `mysql create <dbname>` Create a new database with `<dbname>`.
+ `mysql drop <dbname>` Drop a database with `<dbname>`.
+ `mysql off`. Disables `mysql` feature. **Caution: Also drop all DB permanently**.

### `postgresql`

Configure PostgreSQL Database Server.

+ `postgresql` or `postgresql on` Enable PostgreSQL and create default DB.
+ `postgresql create <dbname>` Create a new database with `<dbname>`.
+ `postgresql drop <dbname>` Drop a database with `<dbname>`.
+ `postgresql off`. Disables `postgresql` feature. **Caution: Also drop all DB permanently**.

### `dns`

Configure BIND DNS Server.

+ `dns` or `dns on` Enable DNS server.
+ `dns add <type> <value>` Add a record.
+ `dns rem <type> <value>` Deletes a record.
+ `dns off`. Disables `dns` feature. **Caution: Also clears all DNS records**.

You can add multiple records with lists. For example:

```yaml
features:
- dns:
  - add a sub-a 1.2.3.4
  - add aaaa sub-a 2001:1:2:3:4:5:6:7
  - add cname sub-b example.net.
  - add cname sub-c example.net.
```

DNS records for child server is handled automatically.

:::info

When applying CNAME, looks out for the trailing dot (`.`) at the end of CNAME values. 

It is required to specify the root domain, otherwise it will be appended with the parent domain.

:::


:::tip

DNS records is also configurable via [Webmin DNS](./virtualmin).

:::

### `firewall`

Configure Whitelist Firewall.

+ `firewall on` or `firewall` Enable firewall.
+ `firewall off` Disable firewall.

Firewall is an additional protection to make sure the host won't send any outgoing request not defined [in the whitelist](https://github.com/domcloud/bridge/blob/main/src/whitelist/sites.conf). 

It's intended for use of hosts with [low security measures](https://github.com/domcloud/domcloud/issues/10). It's recommended for any host who doesn't use any third-party API.

:::caution

Please note due to obvious PHP weakness in security, it's advised to turn on this feature for WordPress or any weakly protected PHP server.

:::


### `ssl`

Configure SSL or Attempt to renew SSL certificate with Let's Encrypt.

+ `ssl` or `ssl letsencrypt`, renew SSL certificate with Let's Encrypt.
+ `ssl always` Always redirect HTTP to HTTPS
+ `ssl on` Enable both HTTP to HTTPS
+ `ssl off` Disable HTTPS access (not recommended)

### `http`

Configure HTTP version for HTTPS.

+ `http 1` use HTTP version 1
+ `http 2` use HTTP version 2

### `root`

Set directory root path. This also changes the `root` directive in NGINX config.

:::info
`root` is configurable both in `features:` and `nginx:`. The following is equivalent:

```yaml
features:
- root: public_html/public
```

```yaml
nginx:
  root: public_html/public
```

:::

### `php`

Set PHP (FastCGI) version. Available options:

+ `php 7.4`
+ `php 8.0`
+ `php 8.1`

+ `php latest` (default)

Remember that `php 8.x` is an active release. 

This also sets the `php` (and `composer`) to the right version in CLI/SSH. 

PHP files that served through NginX are served with `php-fpm` (FastCGI Process Manager).

### `node`

Install specific NodeJS version. Available options:

+ `node` or `node lts`
+ `node latest`
+ `node beta`
+ `node x.y.z`
+ `node off`

+ `python` or `python latest`
+ `python x.y`
+ `python x.y.z`
+ `python off`

By default it's Python 3.9 provided from system.

This also sets the `python` (and `pip`) to the right version in CLI/SSH. This installation is powered by [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv).

### `ruby`

## `nginx`

Configures NGINX for a given website. Common examples:

```yaml
# Standard NGINX setup for PHP framework 
nginx:
  root: public_html/public
  fastcgi: on
  locations:
  - match: /
    try_files: $uri $uri/ /index.php$is_args$args
```

```yaml
# Standard NGINX setup for Node.js via GLS
nginx:
  root: public_html/public
  passenger:
    enabled: on
    app_start_command: env PORT=$PORT node server.js
```

```yaml
# Standard NGINX setup for Python through WSGI
nginx:
  root: public_html/public
  passenger:
    enabled: on
    python: .pyenv/shims/python
features:
  - python # This install python to .pyenv/shims/python
commands:
  - echo "from app import app as application" > passenger_wsgi.py    
```

All configurations below are not preserved at each config update. It's recommended to use the `NGINX` tab in the dashboard to reconfigure NGINX.

### `fastcgi`

Whether to enable or not enable PHP file execution: `on`, `always` or `off`. If omitted, `off` is the default.

:::tip

Read more about `fastcgi` option in [Deployment for PHP](../deployment/php.mdx#nginx-setup).

:::

### `error_pages`

List of error pages command. It's particularly useful for static websites. Read on [the NGINX docs](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#error_page).

+ `404 /404.html`: Show `404` error page as `404.html`.
+ `404 =200 /200.html`: Assume `404` error as 200 OK and show `200.html` (SPA).
+ `500 502 503 504 /50x.html`: Show `50x` error as `50x.html`.

### `passenger`

If you want to run Non-PHP apps, you need to setup with [Passenger Phusion](https://www.phusionpassenger.com/). Passenger is an additional layer on top of NGINX to run any non-PHP apps.

To enable non-PHP apps, at minimum you need these configuration:

```yaml
root: public_html/public
nginx:
  passenger:
    enabled: on
    app_start_command: node server.js --port=$PORT
```

The configuration above will execute `node server.js --port=$PORT` in the parent of root folder (in this case, `~/public_html`). Note that you always need to pass the `$PORT` and use that as the port where your app is listening to. If your app accept port from environment instead you can use env like `env PORT=$PORT node server.js`.

For custom environment values you can leverage `app_env` and `env_var_list`.

To restart a non-PHP apps you can execute `passenger-config restart-app /` in CLI/SSH. You can also make it [always restart](https://www.phusionpassenger.com/library/admin/apache/restart_app.html#restart-txt) if you have to.

Available options:

+ [`enabled`](https://www.phusionpassenger.com/docs/references/config_reference/nginx/#passenger_enabled): `on` or `off` (default)
+ [`app_env`](https://www.phusionpassenger.com/docs/references/config_reference/nginx/#passenger_app_env): environment setup. Either `production` (default) or `development`.
+ [`env_var_list`](https://www.phusionpassenger.com/docs/references/config_reference/nginx/#passenger_env_var): array of environment values in the format of `KEY=VALUE`.
+ [`app_start_command`](https://www.phusionpassenger.com/docs/references/config_reference/nginx/#passenger_app_start_command): [Passenger GLS](https://www.phusionpassenger.com/docs/advanced_guides/gls/) command to start the app with `$PORT` as the port where your app is listening to.
+ [`friendly_error_pages`](https://www.phusionpassenger.com/docs/references/config_reference/nginx/#passenger_friendly_error_pages): `on` (default) or `off`
+ [`base_uri`](https://www.phusionpassenger.com/docs/references/config_reference/nginx/#passenger_base_uri): base URL for the app (default is `/`).
+ [`sticky_sessions`](https://www.phusionpassenger.com/docs/references/config_reference/nginx/#passenger_sticky_sessions): `on` or `off` (default). Enable this for websocket support.
+ [`document_root`](https://www.phusionpassenger.com/docs/references/config_reference/nginx/#passenger_document_root): path to public document root (default is `root`). This value is relative to the user `$HOME` folder.
+ [`app_root`](https://www.phusionpassenger.com/docs/references/config_reference/nginx/#passenger_app_root): path to app root (default is parent of `root`). This value is relative to the user `$HOME` folder.

For non-GLS (an alternative way if not using `app_start_command`) these options are available too:
+ [`app_type`](https://www.phusionpassenger.com/docs/references/config_reference/nginx/#passenger_app_type): Type of App
+ [`startup_file`](https://www.phusionpassenger.com/docs/references/config_reference/nginx/#passenger_startup_file): Startup filename
+ [`ruby`](https://www.phusionpassenger.com/docs/references/config_reference/nginx/#passenger_ruby): Path to Ruby executable
+ [`nodejs`](https://www.phusionpassenger.com/docs/references/config_reference/nginx/#passenger_nodejs): Path to Node.JS executable
+ [`python`](https://www.phusionpassenger.com/docs/references/config_reference/nginx/#passenger_python): Path to Python executable
+ [`meteor_app_settings`](https://www.phusionpassenger.com/docs/references/config_reference/nginx/#passenger_meteor_app_settings): Path to Meteor app settings

:::tip

Read more about `passenger` option for general app in [NGINX and App daemon](./nginx.mdx#configure-nginx-for-general-apps).

:::

### `locations`

Array objects which one or more of:

+ `match`: Matching URL location (required)
+ `root`: Root path (relative to `$HOME`)
+ `alias`: Alias path (relative to `$HOME`)
+ `rewrite`: Rewrite URL directive
+ `try_files`: Try files URL directive
+ `return`: Return code directive
+ `fastcgi`: (same as above)
+ `passenger`: (same as above)

Please read [NGINX Location directive](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#location) for more information.

:::info

`proxy_pass`, although it's popular, it's not allowed because it's not a good practice to use it in a shared servers. You must use `passenger` instead.

:::

---


## `commands`

Type: array of `string`.

List of SSH commands in sequence. The starting directory is always `~/public_html`. If any exit code detected to be not zero, the execution chain stop.

This is where all the terminal commands written, for example to install depedencies, compiling binaries or injecting database credential.

The list of commands is always executed after the `source` and `features` and before `nginx`.

#### Builtin envar for commands

Aside with the usual SSH commands, it does have an additional envar to help with scripting:

+ `$USERNAME`: The username.
+ `$DATABASE`: The database name (usually `${USERNAME}_db` but can be changed if new database name is supplied before).
+ `$PASSWORD`: The user login password.
+ `$DOMAIN`: The domain name.

These envars also will be set:

+ `CI=true`
+ `CONTINUOUS_INTEGRATION=true`
+ `DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive`
+ `LANG=en_US.UTF-8`
+ `LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8`

#### Builtin Git Credentials

If you have logged in with GitHub with repo access, an envar `$GITHUB_TOKEN` will be available for you to use. Together with Git Credentials API, it will grant the access to your private repos along with all `git` commands run from the Runner.

This is useful for cloning or pulling private repos after a webhook is received, for example.

:::caution

This does have security implication and we have taken some security measures to prevent leaks. For example, since it's provided within envar, you `git` commands will break if run within SSH. That's because its doesn't saved anywhere in the server.

We doesn't prevent you, for example to run `echo $GITHUB_TOKEN` in the `commands` list and use it as the token used for SSH session. But we do recommend you to not do that.

:::

#### Time limit

The time limit for overall script in single run is 10 minutes. If it's exceeded, the execution chain will automatically stop by signaling both `SIGTERM` and `SIGKILL`.

---

## `subdomains` and `subdomain`

`subdomains` is used to run specific commands for a given `subdomain` name. It's an array of objects with `subdomain`, some of the `features` and `commands` keys.

When `subdomains` are used, some definitions such as `source`, `nginx`, `features` and `commands` is adjusted to apply for a given subdomain name, including changing the root exection to `~/domains/<subdomain_name>/public_html` instead of `~/public_html`.
