DNS is a service that translates domain names to IP addresses. 

Usually, it's enabled automatically for a given website if used with a custom domain. If you host a website with a custom domain, you can point the name server to these below to use our DNS service:

```
nsp.domcloud.io
nss.domcloud.io
```

To add custom records to your domain, you can use the DNS Manager via Webmin. You can also add or delete DNS records using [the runner](./runner.md#dns).
