The free plan has no time limit. However to prevent spam you have to reactivate every three months by logging in to portal and perform extension.

Here are some common question about choosing the right plan for the budget:

### What is a Subserver

A subserver is essentially a separate host with files contents.

A subserver is usually used for creating subdomains with the same user folder. For example, if you want to create a subdomain `my.example.com` with the same user as `example`, you can create a subserver with the same user and a new site will be placed under `~/domains/my.example.com/public_html`.

### What are benefits of using paid Plans?

Paid plans is available to purchase using PayPal, and using these gains your hosting additional features:

+ No more 3 month limit expiration
+ Can use any custom domain you want
+ Can use DNS feature
+ Can purchase additional network bandwidth
+ Can never be accidentally deleted (until it expires)


### Can I switch plan later?

Yes, you can upgrade from free plan to any paid plan anytime. You can also upgrade or purchase additional bandwidth quota after you bought your initial plan.

However, during your paid plan term, you can't downgrade unless it's nearly expiring (in under 1 month). For technical reasons right now you can't ever go back to free plan if you have already purchased a paid plan before.
