# Deploy Static Sites

Static sites are websites that doesn't require server processing (e.g. connecting with database), so it only consist of HTML, CSS, JS files that sent as-is to the browser.

While static sites are works out of the box, modern static sites needed to build from many kinds of frontend tooling such as [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/), [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and many more.

## Pulling the code

You can [upload existing files](../features/editor.mdx) from your local machine or pull it from a Git repository:

```yaml
# Clone from Git repository and write it to ~/public_html
source: https://github.com/octocat/octocat.github.io
```

## Building the site

If your site need to be built with a frontend tooling, you need to build it after pulling the code and adjust the NGINX configuration to serve the built files correctly.

  <TabItem value="create-react-app" label="Create React App" default>

```yaml
# If you want to create from stratch, let's create a new template
source: clear
commands:
- yarn create react-app .
# Install latest Node.js
features:
- node lts
```

```yaml
# Build the site (after pulling or modifying the code)
commands:
- yarn install
- yarn build
```

```yaml
# Adjust NGINX (you only need to do this once)
nginx:
  # Set the root directory to the build directory
  root: public_html/build
  # Serve index.html for all requests
  locations:
  - match: /
    try_files: $uri $uri/ /index.html
```
