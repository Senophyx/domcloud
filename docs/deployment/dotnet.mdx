# Deploy .NET Apps

[.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/) is a programming language family popularly used within Microsoft ecosystem, which includes C#, VB and F# languages. .NET is served as an compile language, which means you need to compile your code before running it. 

There is no default `dotnet` compiler at system level. You have to install it first through deployment scripts.


:::warning

Serving .NET apps requires to be run via GLS, that's mean you have to listen from given `PORT` env/args.

## Example

TODO

## Existing .NET projects

TODO

## Use other .NET versions

To switch dotnet version use feature syntax like `dotnet latest`, `dotnet 0.8.0`, etc. Check your current dotnet version using `dotnet --version` in SSH.

```yaml
features:
  - dotnet 0.9.0
```

.NET install scripts is powered by [dotnet-install script](https://dot.net/v1/dotnet-install.sh). 

## App Management

Your app do not restarted automatically after file changes. To restart, run `restart` via SSH.

Environment variables can be set either using NGINX's `env_var_list` or `~/.bashrc`. Usually your language framework also reads `.env` files.

See [NGINX and App Daemon](../features/nginx.mdx) for more information about NGINX and App managements including restarting, environment variables, and other global limitations.

## App Logging

We do not have built-in logging capability at this time. Only startup problems displayed in the browser.

Please use a proper logging mechanism such as [the standard logging library](https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/core/fundamentals-of-logging-in-dotnet-core) then write it to a log file, or any other solution that suits you.

NGINX errors and traffic logs can be examined via Webmin.
