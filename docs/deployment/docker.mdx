# Deploy Docker Apps (Pro Plan Only)

Docker in DOM Cloud is powered by [Podman](https://podman.io/). It's always run in rootless mode and allows running 24/7. Because of how powerful and resouce consuming this is only available with `Pro` user plan.

The `podman` CLI is available as a system-wide install packages. `docker` is simply an alias to `podman`. A preconfiguration is required by activating `podman` feature via system runner to assign `subuid` and `subgid` and instructing system-wide killer programs to not killing any background processes for current host.

:::warning

Experimental! Currently activated only in Singapore servers. Contact us to make it available for other servers.
