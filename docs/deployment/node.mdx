# Deploy Node.js Apps

Node.js is a highly-efficient JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code as a server.
Node.js is served using Phusion Passenger inside NGINX.

Popular Node.js recipes include [Express](https://expressjs.com/), [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Nuxt.js](https://nuxt.com/), [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/). Please read our [Runner's Guide](../features/runner.mdx) first if you haven't.

:::info

This guide only covers running a Node.js server, not about statically rendered pages like from `Create React App`, `Webpack`, `Parcel` or `Gatsby`.
If your application is intented to be as a static site, you should read our [Static Site Guide](./static-site.mdx) instead.

## Recipes

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="express" label="Express" default>

### Init in Development Mode

```yaml
source: clear
features:
  - node lts
nginx:
  root: public_html/public
  passenger:
    enabled: on
    app_env: development
    app_start_command: env PORT=$PORT npx nodemon ./bin/www
commands:
- npx express-generator --view=pug --css=less --git .
- npm i
- npm add -D nodemon
```

A simple express website with [nodemon](https://nodemon.io/) for development.

### Switch to Production Mode

```yaml
nginx:
  root: public_html/public
  passenger:
    enabled: on
    app_start_command: env PORT=$PORT npm start
```

This switches Express to production mode.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="next" label="Next.js" default>

### Init in Development Mode

```yaml
source: clear
features:
  - node lts
nginx:
  root: public_html/public
  passenger:
    enabled: on
    app_env: development
    app_start_command: env PORT=$PORT yarn dev
commands:
  - yarn create next-app .
```

A bootstrapped Next.js website run in development mode (HMR works automatically).

### Switch to Production Mode

```yaml
nginx:
  root: public_html/public
  passenger:
    enabled: on
    app_start_command: env PORT=$PORT yarn start
  locations:
    - match: /_next/
      alias: public_html/.next/
commands:
- yarn build
```

This builds and switches Next.js to production mode.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="nuxt" label="Nuxt.js" default>

### Init in Development Mode

```yaml
source: clear
features:
  - node lts
nginx:
  root: public_html/public
  passenger:
    enabled: on
    app_env: development
    app_start_command: env PORT=$PORT yarn dev
commands:
  - npx nuxi init .
  - yarn
```

A bootstrapped Nuxt.js website run in development mode.

:::caution

WIP: HMR does not work with Nuxt.js yet.

### Switch to Production Mode

```yaml
nginx:
  root: public_html/.output/public
  passenger:
    enabled: on
    app_start_command: env PORT=$PORT node server/index.mjs
commands:
  - yarn build
```

This builds and switches Nuxt.js to production mode.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="sveltekit" label="SvelteKit" default>

### Init in Development Mode

```yaml
source: clear
features:
  - node lts
nginx:
  root: public_html/static
  passenger:
    enabled: 'on'
    app_env: development
    app_start_command: 'yarn dev --port $PORT --host'
commands:
  - yes "" | yarn create svelte > /dev/null
  - yarn
```

A bootstrapped SvelteKit website run in development mode (HMR works automatically).


### Switch to Production Mode

```yaml
nginx:
  root: public_html/.svelte-kit/output/client
  passenger:
    enabled: on
    app_start_command: yarn preview --port $PORT --host
    app_root: public_html
commands:
  - yarn build
```

This builds and switches SvelteKit to production mode.

Let's extract those recipes meaning individually.

## Node environment

The default Node version is `16.x`, which is the default provided from the OS.

To change Node version used to the latest (LTS) one, put this in runner:

```yaml
features:
- node lts
```

It will install node in userland and all binaries will use it instead of the default one.

You can also install other or specific version of Node.js e.g. `node latest`,  `node beta`,  `node 16.3.2`. This action will install Node.js in userland with the help of [webi script](https://webinstall.dev/node/) and [enabling Corepack](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest/docs/api/corepack.html) so package managers (npm & yarn & pnpm) can be used alongside userland node.

## NGINX Setup

Binding Node.js through NGINX is done by Passenger. To make the binding work, you need to make sure that your app can open port number using given environment variable (.e.g. `PORT`), and you point the root of your public file to a `public` directory.

```yaml
root: public_html/public
nginx:
  passenger:
    enabled: on
    app_start_command: env PORT=$PORT npm start
```

If your setup is complex (e.g. using multiple websites in a domain) you can tell which exactly the `app_root` directory your app is serving from. Just make sure your root directory is outside of your app directory.

```yaml
root: public_html/client/dist
nginx:
  locations:
  - match: /api
    passenger:
      enabled: on
      app_start_command: env PORT=$PORT npm start
      app_root: public_html/server
```

Some frameworks like `Next.js` likes to serve a hidden static directory e.g. `/_next`. We can reduce server load by creating an extra `/_next` location so those files is directly handled (and properly cached) by NGINX.

```yaml
nginx:
  locations:
    # optimizing static cache
    - match: /_next/
      alias: public_html/.next/
```

## Package Install

Package installs can be done just like usual `npm/yarn/pnpm install` command. For a little advice, using these extra options is recommended in production:

```
npm ci
yarn install --immutable
```

### Clear packager cache

In meantime if your development has stable enough, you may want to clear the packager cache to save space.

```
npm cache clean --force
yarn cache clean --force
pnpm cache clean --force
```

## Node.js Error Logs

When your Node.js crashed during startup, a helpful error will be displayed in the browser. This aids you to diagnose if some configuration is wrong.

(TODO) Unfortunately, we haven't found a way to capture Node.js error logs yet. You can (should?) do error logging to files using [builtin Node.js Console API](https://melvingeorge.me/blog/save-logs-to-files-nodejs) or use [Winston](https://www.npmjs.com/package/winston).
