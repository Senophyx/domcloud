# Deploy Java Apps

[Java](https://openjdk.org) is a programming language popularly used globally. Java is served as a compiled language, which means you need to compile your code before running it. 

There is no default `java` compiler at system level. You have to install it first through deployment scripts.


:::warning

Serving Java apps requires to be run via GLS, that's mean you have to listen from given `PORT` env/args.

## Example

TODO

## Existing Java projects

TODO

## Use other Java versions

TODO (install it yourself)

## App Management

Your app do not restarted automatically after file changes. To restart, run `restart` via SSH.

Environment variables can be set either using NGINX's `env_var_list` or `~/.bashrc`. Usually your language framework also reads `.env` files.

See [NGINX and App Daemon](../features/nginx.mdx) for more information about NGINX and App managements including restarting, environment variables, and other global limitations.

## App Logging

We do not have built-in logging capability at this time. Only startup problems displayed in the browser.

Please use a proper logging mechanism such as [log4j](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/) then write it to a log file, or any other solution that suits you.

NGINX errors and traffic logs can be examined via Webmin.
