Here in this page we will take a basic understanding about how DOM Cloud works and how to set up your own website quickly.

## Create a Website

Go to [create a website](https://my.domcloud.co/user/host/create) page. If you haven't logged in, you will be redirected to the login page. Below is the screenshot of that page.

<ThemedImage
    sources={{
        dark: "/assets/ss/new-purchase-b.png",
        light: "/assets/ss/new-purchase-w.png"
    }}
    alt=""
    className="img-fluid border rounded-3 shadow--md mb-4"
    width="700"
    height="500"
    loading="lazy"
/>

The left side is the template you want to start with, while the right side sets the domain name and the server where you want to host your website. You can choose a template, the domain name and a server, then click the "Add Host" button. We explain more below.

### Right side

It has three fields: Username, Region, and Domain. 

#### Username

This is the username you want to use to login to your website. You can use any username you want, but it must be unique. The username is invisible to the public, except if you choose a free domain.

#### Region

This is the server where you want to host your website. You can choose any server you want that is available, preferably close with your target audience.

#### Domain

This is the domain name you want to use for your website. By default, it will be `[username].domcloud.io`, which is part of a free domain name provided by us. 


:::info

You can also use your own domain name, but you need to configure it first. <br/> Read more about [Custom Domain](../integration/cname.mdx).

:::

### Left side

It's a template selector. It has three sections: Start From Template, Clone From GitHub, Custom Template.

#### Start From Template

The template is a pre-configured website that you can use as a starting point. It's mostly a preconfigured web apps that works out of the box.

#### Clone From GitHub

For some developers who already have the website code on GitHub, you can clone it directly to DOM Cloud. It will ask for GitHub access so it can clone your repository even if it's private.


:::info

If you plan to integrate our service with GitHub, there's so much more to read about it. Read more about [GitHub integration](../integration/github.mdx).

:::


#### Custom Template

This is the actual "template" that will be executed after the website has been created. When you choose option from **Start From Template** or **Clone From GitHub**, it will be automatically set to the template that is used by the selected option.

### Click "Add Host"

After clicking the "Add Host" button, you will be redirected to the runner page of the newly created website where you can watch the progress of the setup. Below is the screenshot of that page.

<ThemedImage
    sources={{
        dark: "/assets/ss/new-progress-b.png",
        light: "/assets/ss/new-progress-w.png"
    }}
    alt=""
    className="img-fluid border rounded-3 shadow--md mb-4"
    width="700"
    height="500"
    loading="lazy"
/>

You have to wait until the setup is finished.

When it finished there will be a message saying "Your website is ready!" and a button to open the website when it's ready.

## Managing Website

Every website has its own dashboard. Below is the screenshot of that page.

<ThemedImage
    sources={{
        dark: "/assets/ss/dash-b.png",
        light: "/assets/ss/dash-w.png"
    }}
    alt=""
    className="img-fluid border rounded-3 shadow--md mb-4"
    width="700"
    height="500"
    loading="lazy"
/>

The **Info** section contains information about your website, such as some general information including storage usage, bandwidth usage, and the server where your website is hosted.

One particular useful tab that you'll use often is the **Manage** tab. It contains links to edit your website and also credentials to access your website. Below is the screenshot of that page.


<ThemedImage
    sources={{
        dark: "/assets/ss/new-manage-b.png",
        light: "/assets/ss/new-manage-w.png"
    }}
    alt=""
    className="img-fluid border rounded-3 shadow--md mb-4"
    width="700"
    height="500"
    loading="lazy"
/>

Tools that you can use to manage your website are:

#### Webmin

Webmin is a web-based system management tool. It's mostly useful for managing files using a web interface. You can also use that to manage your databases (like adding new databases or importing from server files).

#### PhpMyAdmin / PhpPgAdmin

PhpMyAdmin and PhpPgAdmin is a web-based database management tool for MariaDB and PostgreSQL, respectively. During entry, you will be asked for the database username and password, which is the same as your website username and password (in Manage tab).


:::info

If you have problem accessing the database, you need to enable the database first through the **Deploy** tab. <br/> Read more about [Configuring Databases](../features/database.mdx).

:::


#### 

#### WebSSH

WebSSH is a web-based SSH client. It's useful for advanced installation that requires CLI access.


:::warning

The WebSSH URL contains password in your URL for convenience. Don't open it on a shared computer. <br/> Open the link from the dropdown menu instead (which clears password in the URL).

:::

#### Visual Studio Code

This a link to [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to remotely edit the website using SSH. It's required to have the VS code installed on your computer. During entry, you will be asked for the SSH password, which is the same as your website password.

:::tip

You can open the website in VS code in a particular directory (such as `./public_html`) to avoid slowdown by loading all userspace files, by opening the link from the dropdown menu.

:::

## Deploy Tab

The deploy tab is where you can configure the rest of your website. Below is the screenshot of that page.

<ThemedImage
    sources={{
        dark: "/assets/ss/new-progress-b.png",
        light: "/assets/ss/new-progress-w.png"
    }}
    alt=""
    className="img-fluid border rounded-3 shadow--md mb-4"
    width="700"
    height="500"
    loading="lazy"
/>

**It's a powerful tool** to configure (or automate) your website setup. It allows you to:

+ Configure NGINX rules and define how to boots up your websites
+ Configure databases, DNS, TLS, and other services
+ Install additional languages and tools
+ Run custom scripts to automate your deployment

This feature alone is what makes DOM Cloud different from other hosting providers. It's a powerful tool that allows you to configure your website in any way you want. We have dozens of templates (called *recipes*) to setup your website with various languages and tools. You can also create your own recipes and share it with others.

[**Read more about Deployments via Deploy Tab**](../deployment/)

## Other things to aware

This section covers advanced concepts that you need to know to use DOM Cloud. Refer back to our [architecture system diagram](#system-architecture) for overall overview.

- [Firewall Daemon and Ports](../features/firewall.mdx)
- [Proxy and App Daemon](../features/nginx.mdx)
- [Database Daemon](../features/database.mdx)
- [DNS Daemon](../features/dns.mdx)
- [System Runner](../features/runner.mdx)
- [Webmin and Virtualmin](../features/virtualmin.mdx)

There's also [a dedicated page](../deployment/) for configuring a website for specific code language such as [PHP](../deployment/php.mdx), [Node.JS](../deployment/node.mdx), [Python](../deployment/python.mdx) or with [many CMS platforms](../deployment/cms.mdx) or with [many static page generator](../deployment/static-site.mdx) and so on. And also [a dedicated page](../integration/) for integration with [GitHub](../integration/github.mdx), [VS Code](../integration/vscode.mdx), [third-party custom domain](../integration/cname.mdx), and soon.
