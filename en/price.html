    - id: faq03
      title: Are there any other costs besides hosting?
      body: <p>If you want a domain that ends in other than <b>.dom.my.id</b>,  you can purchase the domain <a href="/domain.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">listed here</a>. In addition there is an additional fee of 50 cents on every transaction in the DOM Cloud.</p>
    - id: faq04

      title: The difference between storage and bandwidth?
      body: <p>Storage is a usage limit that is calculated as the total capacity of files, databases, and other server data. While Bandwidth is the limit of data sent within a certain time.</p>
    - id: faq11
      title: What is the principle of bandwidth limitation?
      body: <p>The bandwidth shown is the bandwidth per year. However, the effective limitation is done per month. For example, for the Freedom plan you get 18 GB of bandwidth, then you are limited to 1.5 GB each month. This restriction will be reset at the beginning of each month.</p>
    - id: faq12
      title: How do you calculate bandwidth requirements?
      body: <p>You can do a quick calculation with the average website size of 256 KB per page. For example, with the Freedom plan limitation of 1.5 GB per month, you can get a maximum traffic of around 6000 views per month. This figure can be increased even further if you optimize the size of the website, using a CDN or purchase additional bandwidth.</p>
    - id: faq13
      title: I feel that the capacity given is lacking
      body: <p>As a website owner, it is also your obligation to optimize resource usage. This is a reminder that you always check website performance so that it remains responsive and good for SEO. If your media resource demands are high, you can use third party file storage such as Google Drive, Dropbox, AWS S3 or Cloudinary.</p><p>If you just want more additional bandwidth, you can purchase it as add-ons at 5 cents per GiB.</p>

      title: Aren't there Unlimited options?
      body: <p>Several other hosting providers claim to provide Unlimited storage and bandwidth. This is not always true, because the host uses "Fair Usage" for which we do not know the exact "fair" limits. DOM Cloud breaks this confusion by explaining the limits you actually get in each price range.</p>
    - id: faq22
      title: Where is the server located?
      body: <p>DOM Cloud does not build its own servers. DOM Cloud is a hosting service on top of the Digital Ocean Infrastructure and we are currently installing the main server in Singapore.</p>
    - id: faq23
      title: Does DOM Cloud have an Uptime Guarantee?
      body: <p>The DOM Cloud server is guaranteed by the <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/platform/droplet-policies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">99.99% Uptime Droplet SLA</a>, however DOM Cloud itself does not guarantee downtime caused by maintenance, operator error or certain cyber attacks.</p>
