    title: The difference between storage and bandwidth?
    body: <p>Storage is a usage limit that is calculated as the total capacity of files, databases, and other server data. While Bandwidth is the limit of data sent within a certain time.</p>

    title: What is the principle of bandwidth limitation?
    body: <p>The bandwidth shown is the bandwidth per year. However, the effective limitation is done per month. For example, for the Freedom plan you get 18 GB of bandwidth, then you are limited to 1.5 GB each month. This restriction will be reset at the beginning of each month.</p>

    title: How do you calculate bandwidth requirements?
    body: <p>You can do a quick calculation with the average website size of 256 KB per page. For example, with the Freedom plan limitation of 1.5 GB per month, you can get a maximum traffic of around 6000 views per month. This figure can be increased even further if you optimize the size of the website, using a CDN or purchase additional bandwidth.</p>

    title: I feel I need way more capacity
    body: <p>As a website owner, it is also your responsibility to optimize resource usage. This itself is a reminder so that your website performance remains optimal and good for SEO. If your media resource demands are high, you can use third party file storage such as Google Drive, Dropbox, AWS S3 or Cloudinary.</p><p>If you just want more additional bandwidth, you can purchase it as add-ons at 5 cents per GiB.</p>
