In a very narrow free time window I successfully redesign (again) the landing page, in fewer than 24 hours!

The new design reflects more about what this service about: it's for the niche, but packed with lots of server tooling that (hopefully) makes your dev life easier.

I captured the screenshot (in video) below. I like the dark mode button!

<video width="100%" loop muted controls>
  <source src={theVideo} type="video/webm" />
  Sorry! Your browser does not support the video tag.

If you wonder, this new landing site is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io), replacing our old simple website that's powered by Jekyll. I saved [the old site in archive.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20220612080708/https://domcloud.co/) if you wanted to see the difference.

Anyway, I feel sorry that the proper blog and docs are just live today. Actually, a lot has gotten since 2 years I've been making this platform. Let's hope it get better every time!
